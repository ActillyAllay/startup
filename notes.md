## Git

Git is a system used for tracking and saving version histories of a file directory. It can also pull and push from a repository hosted on the cloud at GitHub.

Get into the habit of _Pull -> Code and Test -> Commit -> Push_

I was initally struggling to push over to GitHub on my first RespositoryTest, as my computer terminal wouldn't accept a password or the copy-pasted personal access token. I installed the GitHub Command Line Tool or cli, and that has fixed the problem as of now.


### Common Commands

`
git init
git status
git log

git add <filename>
git commit
git commit -am <comment>
git checkout <SHA>
gif diff HEAD HEAD~1

git branch <name>
git merge <name>

git clone <url>
git pull
git fetch
git push

`
