> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Proper use of Markdown** - _1/5/26_ - I read the above Markdown documentation. I replaced the placeholder image with a new image to test committing new files and images in Markdown. 
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Whenever my friends and I sit down for a game of Dnd, we love to play background music to match the mood. However, suddenly changing songs can be jarring, and switching between playlists as we move between scenes can be a pain. My startup Loop Deck will give the user control over the way their music loops and changes tracks, with simple hotkeys to streamline the process. Loop Deck can be used to play background music for any task, turning the music from a distraction to a seamless background element.

### Design

![Design image](LoopDeckDesignThumnails.png)

The main page consists of a music player, where users can mess with settings directly, use hotkeys to control the music settings, and add playlists to the queue. The login page allows users to log in to their accounts. Once logged in, users can access the playlists page, where they can input music and create playlists.

    Music Player->>Playlists: Go to saved playlists
    Login Page->>Music Player: After logging in
    Playlists->>Music Player: Listen to playlists
    Playlists->>Playlists: Input music
```

### Key features

- Access music inputted by user
- Play music directly using a media player
- Immediately loop or unloop the music
- Control the fade of music transitions
- Access settings quickly using hotkeys
- Create and save playlists with authorized user login 

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Provide structure to three views: music player, playlists, and login page.
- **CSS** - Add decorative color scheme. Create animated buttons for intuitive controls.
- **React** - Let the user switch between the three views. Respond to user interaction with the music player and playlist settings.
- **Service** - Allow user authentication. Store and retrieve user playlists and settings. Third party call for the music player plugin, or for accessing music.
- **DB/Login** - Storage of user playlists and login information.
- **WebSocket** - Display music progress/changes in realtime with duration bar and queue.
